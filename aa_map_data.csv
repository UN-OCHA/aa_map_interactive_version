"HTI","Haiti","Activated","Tropical cyclones","Activated","","I wanted to share a quick reality-check ahead of the 5 March Stocktake – with thanks to Jean’s advice and feedback. We will continue to push hard for early announcements and clear signals of support, but it will be important to manage expectations and stay realistic about what can credibly be “counted” by 5 March, given donor fiscal/budget cycles and domestic approval processes and donor funding policies. For reference, I’ve included at the end a table showing donors where we currently have announcements/pledges/contributions for the GHO and/or hyper-prioritized GHO.","",""

"HND","Honduras","Endorsed","Drought","Endorsed","","Based on the allocation cycles overview, several donors that are likely to support the GHO/HP-GHO may not be able to formally announce by 5 March because: (a) budget decisions for many Jan–Dec donors (Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, etc.) tend to take place in March–April; (b) April–March donors (e.g., UK, Canada, and Japan) do not align with the Q1 calendar and domestic processes often delay public communications once internal plans are approved; (c) some donors still lack an approved 2026 envelope (e.g., Italy, Switzerland, France) or have approvals routed through Parliament, and importantly (d) some donors have no intention to change their policy of providing unearmarked funding, and entrusting UN and NGO partners with the decision of where to allocate the funds. This means we will only be able to take UN and NGO partners to account for adhering to IASC decisions only towards the end of the year when they report to FTS on how they have used unearmarked funding.","",""

"NER","Niger","Activated","Drought","Activated","Floods","We also have our own limitations in tracking funding against the prioritized GHO because that mapping has not yet been completed for all HRPs and mirrored in FTS. For the time being we thus assume we can count funding promises against the GHO as intended for the prioritized GHO but right now the only donor who has explicitly pledged against the prioritized GHO is the US. All other donors (e.g. ECHO, Germany, UAE) have only mentioned the GHO. That ambiguity also reflects donors still being on the fence of whether all of their resources should go to the prioritized GHO, at the expense of the broader GHO or core funding.","",""

This would make some donors (eg Canada, Norway) more comfortable.
